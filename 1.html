  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language <strong>for creating
  <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript,
  it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
  and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
  and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
  <img src = "coding.jpg" width = "100%">
  </p><p style = "margin-top : 45px;">HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
  With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.
  HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
  for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
  HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</p>
